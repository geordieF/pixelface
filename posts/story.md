title: Storyboarding and Geordie Being Lazyâ„¢

We have created a few pictures for our website.  The design plan was that there would be a single screen for edit with practically infinite pages to choose from the search bar. Obviously, this isn't exactly what happened, we didn't include the page that you're reading right now.

The current design (for the editor) is minimalist, there's just the colour controls and the editor; the file is chosen by changing the URL. This has advantages and disadvantages, but Geordie tells me that he couldn't be bothered to anything more because (I quote)

```yaml
Joon:    hey gnoewdee
Geordie: Hey Joon
Joon:    Your going to add saving to the editor right?
Geordie: *You're
Joon:    F*** off
Joon:    Are you goint to do it?
Geordie: Nah
Joon:    Why
Geordie: It works fine now and i don't have the f***ing time
```
:cry:
